01_KOA_SAD_SEQ_01	I... I think we lost them...
01_PAN_ANG_SEQ_01	We should... We should keep moving.
01_PAN_FE_SEQ_02	If they find us...
01_LIN_ANG_SEQ_01	We won't come back there.
01_LIN_NEU_SEQ_02	But let's get a rest. You all are exhausted.
01_TUC_SUR_SEQ_01	Why... Why aren't you so tired...?
01_CHA_DIS_SEQ_01	Foolish question.. He's a predator, that's why...
01_TUC_CON_SEQ_02	Lucky guy...
01_KOA_SAD_SEQ_02	So... what we do now?
01_TUC_NEU_SEQ_03	Those humans from the zoo are still looking for us...
01_TUC_NEU_SEQ_04	We can't stay here.
01_CHA_NEU_SEQ_02	Agreed. We have to move.
01_PAN_NEU_SEQ_03	Let's go to the mountains, we can hide there!
01_LIN_NEU_SEQ_03	You fool, there is the first place they're gonna look after us!
01_CHA_CON_SEQ_03	Oh, so you have a better idea, mister meat-eating?
01_LIN_NEU_SEQ_04	Does my diet matter something here, lizard?
01_TUC_HAP_SEQ_05	Wohoo, fight, fight, fight!
01_KOA_SAD_SEQ_03	Please, don't start fighting... we have to work togeth--
01_PAN_ANG_SEQ_04	Shut up, weakling! Just stay out of this!
01_KOA_SAD_SEQ_04	B-But...
01_CHI_SAD_SEQ_01	W-Waaaah!
01_PAN_ANG_SEQ_05	For bamboo's sake... keep your kid quiet!
01_PAN_FEA_SEQ_06	They are going to hear us, you dumb marsupial!
01_KOA_SAD_SEQ_05	I-I'm sorry...! Shh, shh, please, stay quiet sweety...
01_CHI_SAD_SEQ_02	S-Sniff...
01_CHA_DIS_SEQ_04	Jeez, it would have been better not bringing the baby with us...
01_KOA_ANG_SEQ_06	Don't you DARE saying that again, you cold lizard!
01_PAN_FEA_SEQ_07	A HUMAN! MAYDAY, MAYDAY!
01_CHA_CON_SEQ_05	Damn... our luck only gets worse...
01_TUC_SUR_SEQ_06	We have to run! Escape, escape!
01_PAN_FEA_SEQ_08	NO! IF IT RUNS AWAY, IT WILL TELL THEM WHERE WE ARE!
01_PAN_ANG_SEQ_09	LET'S HUNT THE HUMAN!
01_KOA_SUR_SEQ_07	A-Are you even listening to yourselves?
01_LIN_ANG_SEQ_05	... *Growls*
02_PRO_NEU_DTR_01	... [stay silent]
02_PRO_NEU_DTR_02	Hello?
02_PRO_FEA_DTR_03	Please, don't hurt me!
02_PAN_ANG_SEQ_01	Don't talk, human! We know your intentions!
02_PAN_ANG_SEQ_02	No one will fool us again!
02_LIN_NEU_SEQ_01	Maybe you should calm down first, Panda.
02_TUC_CON_SEQ_01	Yeah, there's no point in screaming and scaring the human.
02_CHA_DIS_SEQ_01	I don't want that fleeing and warning others of its own.
02_KOA_SAD_SEQ_01	Please, stop fighting... let's talk...
02_TUC_SUR_SEQ_02	Woah, woah! Relax, human!
02_KOA_NEU_SEQ_02	No one is going to hurt you, kiddo.
02_PAN_ANG_SEQ_03	Speak for yourselves, traitors.
02_PAN_ANG_SEQ_04	No human can be trusted. He's a threat!
02_PRO_SAD_DTR_04	Why are you fighting?
02_PRO_FEA_DTR_05	You are scaring me...
02_PRO_ANG_DTR_06	Hey, I'm a good kid!
02_PRO_SAD_DTR_07	Why are you mad at me?
02_PAN_ANG_SEQ_05	Because all of your type are slavers and barbarians!
02_KOA_ANG_SEQ_03	Panda! Just shut up, it's just a kid!
02_PAN_ANG_SEQ_06	Yeah, the worst kind of human!
02_PAN_ANG_SEQ_07	We have to get rid of it right now!
02_CHA_DIS_SEQ_02	Weird assumption coming from one of the species that had us as their slaves.
02_TUC_SUR_SEQ_03	But it's kinda funny, he looks... too small?
02_KOA_ANG_SEQ_04	Because it's a child, you rude people!
02_PAN_ANG_SEQ_08	FOR THE BAMBOO'S SAKE, FOCUS ON THE MAIN POINT!
02_PAN_FEA_SEQ_09	HE'S A THREAT, A BARBARIAN!
02_PAN_ANG_SEQ_10	WE HAVE TO GET RID OF IT!
02_LIN_NEU_SEQ_02	*sigh* Dude, just shut up, please.
02_PRO_ANG_DTR_08	You are being very rude...
02_PRO_SAD_DTR_09	Believe me, I don't want problems...
02_PAN_ANG_SEQ_11	See? No words! I was right about it's guilt!
02_CHA_NEU_SEQ_03	I think you are just being too abrassive.
02_CHA_CON_SEQ_04	The human can't even talk with so much blabbering of yours.
02_TUC_NEU_SEQ_04	Hey, human! Answer something!
02_TUC_CON_SEQ_05	Are you going to be a threat to us?
02_PAN_ANG_SEQ_99	See!?
02_CHA_DIS_SEQ_99	Huh, sketchy.
02_TUC_CON_SEQ_99	Yyyyeh human, at least give us something to work.
02_PAN_ANG_SEQ_12	We can't trust humans! Specialy little demons like you!
02_KOA_ANG_SEQ_05	Panda, that's enough. The kid is clearly no threat to us.
02_LIN_ANG_SEQ_03	Yeah. Just shut up already.
02_PAN_FEA_SEQ_13	B-But...!
02_CHA_NEU_SEQ_05	Before anyone decides anything, there is something I want to know.
02_CHA_NEU_SEQ_06	What are you doing here, if you aren't spying on us?
02_PRO_SAD_DTR_10	I just got lost...
02_PRO_ANG_DTR_11	I don't have to answer you!
02_PAN_ANG_SEQ_14	EXCUSE ME!?
02_CHA_DIS_SEQ_07	Hah, a little cheeky, don't you?
02_TUC_NEU_SEQ_06	Well, the human just pointed the facts.
02_TUC_SUR_SEQ_07	Becausen you are being rude.
02_PRO_FEA_DTR_12	I'm sorry, I'm scared!
02_PRO_ANG_DTR_13	Yeah. Tucan is right!
02_KOA_SAD_SEQ_06	Oh, poor kid...
02_KOA_HAP_SEQ_07	Don't worry. Nothing is going to happen.
02_LIN_NEU_SEQ_04	Well, first control the paranoid racoon here.
02_LIN_NEU_SEQ_05	He looks like a volcano about to explode.
02_PAN_ANG_SEQ_15	HEY!
02_TUC_CON_SEQ_08	I didn't need your agreement, human.
02_TUC_HAP_SEQ_09	But thanks!
02_LIN_CON_SEQ_06	That's all we need, someone telling the tucan he was right...
02_TUC_SUR_SEQ_10	Hey! what do you mean by that, huh!?
02_PRO_NEU_DTR_14	... [remain silent]
02_PRO_ANG_DTR_15	Nope, not saying to you!
02_PAN_ANG_SEQ_16	This is riddiculous!
02_CHA_CON_SEQ_08	Agreed. But I didn't expect too much from it to be honest.
02_TUC_NEU_SEQ_11	You both are just morons, right?
02_PAN_ANG_SEQ_17	EXCUSE ME!?
02_CHA_NEU_SEQ_09	...
02_KOA_NEU_SEQ_08	H-Hello...?
02_PAN_ANG_SEQ_18	Why are you saluting the human!?
02_KOA_SUR_SEQ_09	I-I don't know... Education...?
02_PAN_ANG_SEQ_19	But it's a H U M A N!
02_LIN_CON_SEQ_07	Yeah, we have eyes to see it, genious.
02_CHA_DIS_SEQ_10	Sarcasm doesn't fit you well, sweetheart.
02_TUC_HAP_SEQ_12	Ouch, Chamie 1, Linx 0.
02_LIN_CON_SEQ_08	I don't like any of you, except from the Koala guy.
02_CHA_CON_SEQ_11	Well, at least we share something in common then.
02_PAN_ANG_SEQ_20	GUYS, THERE'S A HUMAN THERE!
02_PAN_NEU_SEQ_21	Can you, I don't know...
02_PAN_ANG_SEQ_22	PAY ATTENTION FOR ONCE AT LEAST!?
02_TUC_CON_SEQ_13	Hey bro, chill. The kid is not moving.
02_TUC_NEU_SEQ_14	Maybe it's dead or something.
02_KOA_SUR_SEQ_10	Don't make that kind of jokes, for eucalyptus sake!
02_TUC_HAP_SEQ_15	Why~? We have a human lover here~?
02_KOA_SUR_SEQ_11	D-Don't be silly!
02_CHA_CON_SEQ_12	Huh... is he being silly, or just accurate?
02_LIN_CON_SEQ_09	Hey, let him alone. He did nothing to you.
02_CHA_DIS_SEQ_13	Now defending the human lover? You, the meat-eater?
02_LIN_CON_SEQ_10	Don't push it, lizard.
02_CHA_DIS_SEQ_14	Or what are you going to do?
02_CHA_DIS_SEQ_15	Eat me, maybe? Hunt me?
02_LIN_ANG_SEQ_11	You are pissing me--
02_KOA_ANG_SEQ_12	PLEASE, STOP, ALL OF YOU!
02_CHA_CON_SEQ_16	Tsk...
02_TUC_NEU_SEQ_16	...
02_TUC_NEU_SEQ_17	Not very talkative, don'tcha?
03_CHA_CON_SEQ_01	However... let's stop wasting time fighting.
03_CHA_NEU_SEQ_02	Threat or not, we are now in a dead point.
03_LIN_NEU_SEQ_01	So... what do we do now?
03_KOA_NEU_SEQ_01	It's already very dark, and the child doesn't seem dangerous.
03_KOA_SAD_SEQ_02	Maybe we should rest...
03_LIN_NEU_SEQ_02	Yeah. Fighting won't solve anything.
03_TUC_NEU_SEQ_01	But... what about the human?
03_TUC_SUR_SEQ_02	We can't just... keep it here.
03_PRO_HAP_DTR_01	I'll be good!
03_PRO_NEU_DTR_02	I'm leaving.
03_KOA_SUR_SEQ_03	But we can't just throw the kid into the forest!
03_KOA_SUR_SEQ_04	Could be dangerous!
03_PAN_DIS_SEQ_01	...Aaand? I particulary don't care if it get's hurt or something.
03_TUC_CON_SEQ_03	What a friendly guy.
03_LIN_NEU_SEQ_03	*sigh* Just keep an eye on him. We'll see tomorrow.
03_PAN_ANG_SEQ_02	You CAN'T be serious!
03_CHA_DIS_SEQ_03	Panda, shut up. It's pointless.
03_PAN_ANG_SEQ_03	You all are desillusional!
03_PAN_FEA_SEQ_04	We will regret this!
03_LIN_NEU_SEQ_04	...
03_LIN_NEU_SEQ_05	Fine. The kid stays.
03_KOA_HAP_SEQ_05	Thanks God...
03_CHA_CON_SEQ_20	But just for this night. We don't trust you yet.
03_TUC_NEU_SEQ_04	Yup. Not a single bit.
03_PAN_ANG_SEQ_05	...
03_PAN_FEA_SEQ_06	You all will regret this. Remember my words.
03_KOA_SUR_SEQ_06	What, wait! No!
03_LIN_CON_SEQ_06	You can't be serious...
03_PAN_FEA_SEQ_07	I TOLD YOU! HE'S GOING TO SELL US TO THE HUMANS!
03_TUC_CON_SEQ_05	Eh, maybe you are overreacting, Panda.
03_TUC_CON_SEQ_06	But yeah, kiddo, you can't go back.
03_CHA_DIS_SEQ_04	We don't trust you. So, we can't let you go just like that.
03_CHA_CON_SEQ_05	Not yet at least.
03_KOA_SAD_SEQ_07	Come on guys...
03_KOA_HAP_SEQ_08	Hey, little child. Just stay here this night.
03_KOA_SAD_SEQ_09	It's dangerous outside in the woods.
03_KOA_HAP_SEQ_10	Tomorrow we'll see what to do, right?
03_KOA_NEU_SEQ_11	Don't be afraid, I won't allow them to touch you.
03_LIN_CON_SEQ_07	*murmuring* As if you could...
03_LIN_NEU_SEQ_08	Well... it seems to be decided.
03_LIN_NEU_SEQ_09	The human stays whatever it wants or not.
04_TUC_HAP_SEQ_01	Oooh, the little human is bored?
04_TUC_CON_SEQ_02	Too bad talking to you makes me lazy.
04_LIN_NEU_SEQ_01	Sorry, human. Not in the mood for a chat
04_PAN_ANG_SEQ_01	Stay away from me, you freak.
04_CHA_DIS_SEQ_01	Why do you even bother talking to me?
04_KOA_HAP_SEQ_01	Oh, kid! Good morning.
04_KOA_NEU_SEQ_02	Did you sleep well?
04_PRO_HAP_DTR_01	Yup! Slept like a baby!
04_PRO_SAD_DTR_02	I had nightmares...
04_KOA_SAD_SEQ_03	Uhm... are you alright?
04_KOA_SAD_SEQ_04	You are too quiet...
04_KOA_HAP_SEQ_05	It's really good to hear that!
04_KOA_SAD_SEQ_06	Oh... I'm sorry to hear that...
04_KOA_NEU_SEQ_07	You need a bit more of rest?
04_KOA_SAD_SEQ_08	I hope we didn't scare you too much yesterday.
04_KOA_SAD_SEQ_09	We were all a little shaken. Sorry about that...
04_PRO_NEU_DTR_03	I'm OK.
04_PRO_HAP_DTR_04	Don't worry!
04_PRO_ANG_DTR_05	You were mean
04_KOA_SUR_SEQ_10	Oh... Sorry about that too...
04_KOA_SAD_SEQ_11	Some of us never had good experiences with humans.
04_KOA_NEU_SEQ_12	But I want to try to see people for what they are.
04_KOA_NEU_SEQ_13	Instead of judging them for how they look.
04_KOA_NEU_SEQ_14	... Alriiight...,
04_KOA_HAP_SEQ_15	Glad to hear that, kid.
04_KOA_SUR_SEQ_16	But I do! A good sleep is necessary!
04_KOA_NEU_SEQ_17	People need to have healthy sleep habits.
04_KOA_NEU_SEQ_18	It doesn't matter what species it belongs to.
04_PRO_HAP_DTR_06	I see, good!
04_PRO_NEU_DTR_07	I don't care.
04_KOA_SUP_SEQ_19	... I was trying to be kind.
04_KOA_NEU_SEQ_20	You don't need to be so gruff ...
04_KOA_HAP_SEQ_21	Yup! I hope we get along, kiddo!
04_KOA_HAP_SEQ_22	However, my name is Gus and this is my daughter, Fae.
04_KOA_NEU_SEQ_23	Nice to meet you...?
04_KOA_NEU_SEQ_24	$playerName, right?
04_KOA_HAP_SEQ_25	Sounds cool!
04_PRO_HAP_DTR_08	Thank you!
04_PRO_NEU_DTR_09	Yeah, whatever.
04_KOA_NEU_SEQ_26	Uh... well...
04_KOA_SUP_SEQ_27	What a polite child...!
04_KOA_HAP_SEQ_28	You're welcome!
04_KOA_SAD_SEQ_29	Uhm, sorry if the comment made you unconfortable...
04_KOA_ANG_SEQ_30	Hey, calm down a bit, will you?
04_KOA_ANG_SEQ_31	I try to be nice, but if you continue like this, I will stop.
04_KOA_NEU_SEQ_32	Think about it.
04_KOA_NEU_SEQ_33	Excuse me, but I have to take care of Fae.
04_KOA_HAP_SEQ_34	It's been a pleasure talking to you, $playerName.
04_KOA_NEU_SEQ_35	Have a good day, $playerName.
05_KOA_HAP_SEQ_01	Good afternoon, $playerName!
05_KOA_NEU_SEQ_02	Maybe later you can play with Fae?
05_KOA_HAP_SEQ_03	She needs to socialize and improve her own confidece.
05_KOA_HAP_SEQ_04	Good afternoon, $playerName.
05_KOA_NEU_SEQ_05	Try not crossing with Panda, he's irritable.
05_KOA_NEU_SEQ_06	Hi.
05_KOA_NEU_SEQ_07	Now I'm busy, sorry
05_CHA_CON_SEQ_08	You are still not trustworthy.
05_CHA_NEU_SEQ_09	We will handle this situation.
05_CHA_NEU_SEQ_10	I have all under control.
05_CHA_NEU_SEQ_11	Order is essential.
05_CHA_CON_SEQ_09	So a kid doesn't belong here.
05_CHA_DIS_SEQ_10	Human stupidity is infinite.
05_TUC_HAP_SEQ_01	Afternoon!
05_TUC_NEU_SEQ_02	I don't recomend you to talk with the crazy Panda.
05_TUC_HAP_SEQ_03	Instead talk with me! We can make some jokes.
05_TUC_CON_SEQ_04	I don't like responsabilities.
05_TUC_NEU_SEQ_05	So if something happens to you, go talk with Lynx or Koala
05_TUC_CON_SEQ_06	Boooring.
05_LIN_NEU_SEQ_01	Good afternoon.
05_LIN_NEU_SEQ_02	If Panda just messes up with you, let me know kiddo.
05_LIN_ANG_SEQ_03	Don't look me like that.
05_LIN_NEU_SEQ_04	I'm not gonna eat you.
05_LIN_ANG_SEQ_05	Mind your own business.
05_LIN_NEU_SEQ_06	...
05_LIN_NEU_SEQ_07	Are you hungry?
05_PRO_SUR_DTR_08	*Stomach growling*
05_PRO_FEA_DTR_09	S-Stay away from me.
05_LIN_NEU_SEQ_07	...
05_LIN_NEU_SEQ_08	You know the basics of a conversation is talking, don't you?
05_LIN_SUR_SEQ_09	...
05_LIN_HAP_SEQ_10	Haha. I'll take that as a 'yes, sir'.
05_LIN_ANG_SEQ_11	Heh, another one.
05_LIN_ANG_SEQ_12	Just because I'm a lynx doesn't mean I'm going to eat you.
05_LIN_NEU_SEQ_13	So relax, human.
05_LIN_NEU_SEQ_14	You prefer meat, or veggies?
05_PRO_SUR_DTR_10	I've never seen a lynx before.
05_PRO_ANG_DTR_11	I don't believe you!
05_LIN_NEU_SEQ_15	Well, there is nothing surprising in being one..
05_LIN_NEU_SEQ_16	We eat, sleep, talk and work like any other being.
05_LIN_NEU_SEQ_17	Surprising, isn't it?
05_LIN_ANG_SEQ_18	Then good luck finding food by yourself.
05_LIN_ANG_SEQ_19	How rude.
05_PRO_SAD_DTR_12	I don't want to be a burden...
05_PRO_NEU_DTR_13	Whataver you want.
05_LIN_NEU_SEQ_18	...
05_LIN_ANG_SEQ_20	*sigh* Well silent kid, you will see.
05_LIN_HAP_SEQ_21	You won't. You're just a child.
05_LIN_NEU_SEQ_22	An adult has to take care of you.
05_LIN_ANG_SEQ_23	Heh, you're starting to sound like the red racoon there.
05_LIN_ANG_SEQ_24	But maybe you should start thinking before talking like that.
05_LIN_ANG_SEQ_25	Koala may have patience. I don't.
05_PRO_HAP_DTR_13	Makes sense, you are like me!
05_PRO_HAP_DTR_14	But you eat people!
05_LIN_SUR_SEQ_25	...
05_LIN_HAP_SEQ_26	Haha! You really are something else, huh?
05_LIN_ANG_SEQ_27	Nevermind. I won't lose time with a rude human.
05_LIN_ANG_SEQ_28	Get out of my sight.
05_LIN_NEU_SEQ_29	Here, take the food.
05_LIN_NEU_SEQ_30	Leave me alone for a while, please.
05_LIN_NEU_SEQ_31	I need to think...
05_PAN_ANG_SEQ_01	YOU WANNA FIGHT?!
05_PAN_CON_SEQ_02	Stay away from me.
05_PAN_CON_SEQ_03	I'm talking seriously, don't make me say it twice.
05_PAN_NEU_SEQ_04	...
05_PAN_CON_SEQ_05	All humans are the same.
05_PAN_NEU_SEQ_06	Stay away from me.
05_PAN_ANG_SEQ_07	Why are you still here!?
05_PRO_SAD_DTR_14	I wanted to know you better...
05_PRO_NEU_DTR_15	Why are you so rude to me?
05_PAN_SUR_SEQ_07	...
05_PAN_FEA_SEQ_08	STOP STARING AT ME LIKE THAT, YOU CREEP!
05_PAN_NEU_SEQ_09	... Are you stupid or something?
05_PAN_NEU_SEQ_10	Why would I want to speak to a barbarian like you?
05_PAN_ANG_SEQ_11	I beg you pardon?
05_PAN_ANG_SEQ_12	Rude? To you? Are you serious?
05_PAN_FEA_SEQ_13	I'm just being cautious! We can't trust you humans!
05_PRO_SAD_DTR_15	Can I be your friend?
05_PRO_HAP_DTR_16	Are you a racoon?
05_PRO_SAD_DTR_17	Because I wanna be your friend.
05_PRO_ANG_DTR_18	I did nothing to you.
05_PRO_SAD_DTR_19	But I did nothing to you...
05_PRO_ANG_DTR_20	You are jelous that I'm human.
05_PAN_SUR_SEQ_13	...
05_PAN_HAP_SEQ_14	PFFFT!! HAHAHAHA!
05_PAN_ANG_SEQ_15	Me? Jelaous? Of you? Why on earth I would?
05_PRO_SAD_DTR_20	Sorry, that was mean of me.
05_PRO_SAD_DTR_21	Because you're a racoon.
05_PAN_CON_SEQ_15	At least you are aware of it. Good.
05_PAN_NEU_SEQ_16	Now, can you leave me alone?
05_PAN_NEU_SEQ_17	You know what? That's all.
05_PAN_ANG_SEQ_18	Get out of my sight. Now.
05_PAN_ANG_SEQ_19	Or I will bite you. Or punch you,
05_PAN_ANG_SEQ_20	Stupid human.
05_PAN_ANG_SEQ_21	I don't want to be friends of you.
05_PAN_NEU_SEQ_22	No human can be trusted.
05_PAN_NEU_SEQ_23	Specially you, the small ones.
05_PAN_SAD_SEQ_24	You're the worst. You are cruel.
05_PAN_NEU_SEQ_25	Well, maybe not you. That's true.
05_PAN_ANG_SEQ_26	But you humans have a long history.
05_PAN_ANG_SEQ_27	Specially those coming to that Zoo.
05_PAN_SAD_SEQ_28	You were terrible living beings.
05_PRO_SAD_DTR_22	Can we be friends?
05_PRO_NEU_DTR_23	[leaves]
05_PRO_SAD_DTR_24	But we all are not the same.
05_PRO_NEU_DTR_25	You are being dramatic.
05_PAN_NEU_SEQ_28	Maybe you are genuinely stupid after all.
05_PAN_NEU_SEQ_29	LEAVE. ME. ALOOOOONE.
05_PAN_NEU_SEQ_30	...
05_PAN_SAD_SEQ_31	Well. Maybe you are right. Who knows.
05_PAN_SAD_SEQ_32	Just... let me rest. I have to think.
05_PAN_NEU_SEQ_33	...
05_PAN_CON_SEQ_34	*sight* Just let me be. I don't wanna talk.
