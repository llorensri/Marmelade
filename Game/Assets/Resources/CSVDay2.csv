04_TUC_HAP_SEQ_01	Oooh, the little human is bored?
04_TUC_CON_SEQ_02	Too bad talking to you makes me lazy.
04_LIN_NEU_SEQ_01	Sorry, human. Not in the mood for a chat
04_PAN_ANG_SEQ_01	Stay away from me, you freak.
04_CHA_DIS_SEQ_01	Why do you even bother talking to me?
04_KOA_HAP_SEQ_01	Oh, kid! Good morning.
04_KOA_NEU_SEQ_02	Did you sleep well?
04_PRO_HAP_DTR_01	Yup! Slept like a baby!
04_PRO_SAD_DTR_02	I had nightmares...
04_KOA_SAD_SEQ_03	Uhm... are you alright?
04_KOA_SAD_SEQ_04	You are too quiet...
04_KOA_HAP_SEQ_05	It's really good to hear that!
04_KOA_SAD_SEQ_06	Oh... I'm sorry to hear that...
04_KOA_NEU_SEQ_07	You need a bit more of rest?
04_KOA_SAD_SEQ_08	I hope we didn't scare you too much yesterday.
04_KOA_SAD_SEQ_09	We were all a little shaken. Sorry about that...
04_PRO_NEU_DTR_03	I'm OK.
04_PRO_HAP_DTR_04	Don't worry!
04_PRO_ANG_DTR_05	You were mean
04_KOA_SUR_SEQ_10	Oh... Sorry about that too...
04_KOA_SAD_SEQ_11	Some of us never had good experiences with humans.
04_KOA_NEU_SEQ_12	But I want to try to see people for what they are.
04_KOA_NEU_SEQ_13	Instead of judging them for how they look.
04_KOA_NEU_SEQ_14	... Alriiight...,
04_KOA_HAP_SEQ_15	Glad to hear that, kid.
04_KOA_SUR_SEQ_16	But I do! A good sleep is necessary!
04_KOA_NEU_SEQ_17	People need to have healthy sleep habits.
04_KOA_NEU_SEQ_18	It doesn't matter what species it belongs to.
04_PRO_HAP_DTR_06	I see, good!
04_PRO_NEU_DTR_07	I don't care.
04_KOA_SUP_SEQ_19	... I was trying to be kind.
04_KOA_NEU_SEQ_20	You don't need to be so gruff ...
04_KOA_HAP_SEQ_21	Yup! I hope we get along, kiddo!
04_KOA_HAP_SEQ_22	However, my name is Gus and this is my daughter, Fae.
04_KOA_NEU_SEQ_23	Nice to meet you...?
04_KOA_NEU_SEQ_24	Alex, right?
04_KOA_HAP_SEQ_25	Sounds cool!
04_PRO_HAP_DTR_08	Thank you!
04_PRO_NEU_DTR_09	Yeah, whatever.
04_KOA_NEU_SEQ_26	Uh... well...
04_KOA_SUP_SEQ_27	What a polite child...!
04_KOA_HAP_SEQ_28	You're welcome!
04_KOA_SAD_SEQ_29	Uhm, sorry if the comment made you unconfortable...
04_KOA_ANG_SEQ_30	Hey, calm down a bit, will you?
04_KOA_ANG_SEQ_31	I try to be nice, but if you continue like this, I will stop.
04_KOA_NEU_SEQ_32	Think about it.
04_KOA_NEU_SEQ_33	Excuse me, but I have to take care of Fae.
04_KOA_HAP_SEQ_34	It's been a pleasure talking to you, Alex.
04_KOA_NEU_SEQ_35	Have a good day, Alex.
05_KOA_HAP_SEQ_01	Good afternoon, Alex!
05_KOA_NEU_SEQ_02	Maybe later you can play with Fae?
05_KOA_HAP_SEQ_03	She needs to socialize and improve her own confidece.
05_KOA_HAP_SEQ_04	Good afternoon, Alex.
05_KOA_NEU_SEQ_05	Try not crossing with Panda, he's irritable.
05_KOA_NEU_SEQ_06	Hi.
05_KOA_NEU_SEQ_07	Now I'm busy, sorry
05_CHA_CON_SEQ_08	You are still not trustworthy.
05_CHA_NEU_SEQ_09	We will handle this situation.
05_CHA_NEU_SEQ_10	I have all under control.
05_CHA_NEU_SEQ_11	Order is essential.
05_CHA_CON_SEQ_12	So a kid doesn't belong here.
05_CHA_DIS_SEQ_13	Human stupidity is infinite.
05_TUC_HAP_SEQ_01	Afternoon!
05_TUC_NEU_SEQ_02	I don't recomend you to talk with the crazy Panda.
05_TUC_HAP_SEQ_03	Instead talk with me! We can make some jokes.
05_TUC_CON_SEQ_04	I don't like responsabilities.
05_TUC_NEU_SEQ_05	So if something happens to you, go talk with Lynx or Koala.
05_TUC_CON_SEQ_06	Boooring.
05_LIN_NEU_SEQ_01	Good afternoon.
05_LIN_NEU_SEQ_02	If Panda just messes up with you, let me know kiddo.
05_LIN_ANG_SEQ_03	Don't look me like that.
05_LIN_NEU_SEQ_04	I'm not gonna eat you.
05_LIN_ANG_SEQ_05	Mind your own business.
05_LIN_NEU_SEQ_06	...
05_LIN_NEU_SEQ_07	Are you hungry?
05_PRO_SUR_DTR_08	*Stomach growling*
05_PRO_FEA_DTR_09	S-Stay away from me.
05_LIN_NEU_SEQ_08	You know the basics of a conversation is talking, don't you?
05_LIN_SUR_SEQ_09	...
05_LIN_HAP_SEQ_10	Haha. I'll take that as a 'yes, sir'.
05_LIN_ANG_SEQ_11	Heh, another one.
05_LIN_ANG_SEQ_12	Just because I'm a lynx doesn't mean I'm going to eat you.
05_LIN_NEU_SEQ_13	So relax, human.
05_LIN_NEU_SEQ_14	You prefer meat, or veggies?
05_PRO_SUR_DTR_10	I've never seen a lynx before.
05_PRO_ANG_DTR_11	I don't believe you!
05_LIN_NEU_SEQ_15	Well, there is nothing surprising in being one..
05_LIN_NEU_SEQ_16	We eat, sleep, talk and work like any other being.
05_LIN_NEU_SEQ_17	Surprising, isn't it?
05_LIN_ANG_SEQ_18	Then good luck finding food by yourself.
05_LIN_ANG_SEQ_19	How rude.
05_PRO_SAD_DTR_12	I don't want to be a burden...
05_PRO_NEU_DTR_13	Whataver you want.
05_LIN_NEU_SEQ_18	...
05_LIN_ANG_SEQ_20	*sigh* Well silent kid, you will see.
05_LIN_HAP_SEQ_21	You won't. You're just a child.
05_LIN_NEU_SEQ_22	An adult has to take care of you.
05_LIN_ANG_SEQ_23	Heh, you're starting to sound like the red racoon there.
05_LIN_ANG_SEQ_24	But maybe you should start thinking before talking like that.
05_LIN_ANG_SEQ_25	Koala may have patience. I don't.
05_PRO_HAP_DTR_13	Makes sense, you are like me!
05_PRO_HAP_DTR_14	But you eat people!
05_LIN_SUR_SEQ_25	...
05_LIN_HAP_SEQ_26	Haha! You really are something else, huh?
05_LIN_ANG_SEQ_27	Nevermind. I won't lose time with a rude human.
05_LIN_ANG_SEQ_28	Get out of my sight.
05_LIN_NEU_SEQ_29	Here, take the food.
05_LIN_NEU_SEQ_30	Leave me alone for a while, please.
05_LIN_NEU_SEQ_31	I need to think...
05_PAN_ANG_SEQ_01	YOU WANNA FIGHT?!
05_PAN_CON_SEQ_02	Stay away from me.
05_PAN_CON_SEQ_03	I'm talking seriously, don't make me say it twice.
05_PAN_NEU_SEQ_04	...
05_PAN_CON_SEQ_05	All humans are the same.
05_PAN_NEU_SEQ_06	Stay away from me.
05_PAN_ANG_SEQ_07	Why are you still here!?
05_PRO_SAD_DTR_14	I wanted to know you better...
05_PRO_NEU_DTR_15	Why are you so rude to me?
05_PAN_SUR_SEQ_07	...
05_PAN_FEA_SEQ_08	STOP STARING AT ME LIKE THAT, YOU CREEP!
05_PAN_NEU_SEQ_09	... Are you stupid or something?
05_PAN_NEU_SEQ_10	Why would I want to speak to a barbarian like you?
05_PAN_ANG_SEQ_11	I beg you pardon?
05_PAN_ANG_SEQ_12	Rude? To you? Are you serious?
05_PAN_FEA_SEQ_13	I'm just being cautious! We can't trust you humans!
05_PRO_SAD_DTR_15	Can I be your friend?
05_PRO_HAP_DTR_16	Are you a racoon?
05_PRO_SAD_DTR_17	Because I wanna be your friend.
05_PRO_ANG_DTR_18	I did nothing to you.
05_PRO_SAD_DTR_19	But I did nothing to you...
05_PRO_ANG_DTR_20	You are jelous that I'm human.
05_PAN_SUR_SEQ_13	...
05_PAN_HAP_SEQ_14	PFFFT!! HAHAHAHA!
05_PAN_ANG_SEQ_15	Me? Jelaous? Of you? Why on earth I would?
05_PRO_SAD_DTR_20	Sorry, that was mean of me.
05_PRO_SAD_DTR_21	Because you're a racoon.
05_PAN_CON_SEQ_15	At least you are aware of it. Good.
05_PAN_NEU_SEQ_16	Now, can you leave me alone?
05_PAN_NEU_SEQ_17	You know what? That's all.
05_PAN_ANG_SEQ_18	Get out of my sight. Now.
05_PAN_ANG_SEQ_19	Or I will bite you. Or punch you,
05_PAN_ANG_SEQ_20	Stupid human.
05_PAN_ANG_SEQ_21	I don't want to be friends of you.
05_PAN_NEU_SEQ_22	No human can be trusted.
05_PAN_NEU_SEQ_23	Specially you, the small ones.
05_PAN_SAD_SEQ_24	You're the worst. You are cruel.
05_PAN_NEU_SEQ_25	Well, maybe not you. That's true.
05_PAN_ANG_SEQ_26	But you humans have a long history.
05_PAN_ANG_SEQ_27	Specially those coming to that Zoo.
05_PAN_SAD_SEQ_28	You were terrible living beings.
05_PRO_SAD_DTR_22	Can we be friends?
05_PRO_NEU_DTR_23	[leaves]
05_PRO_SAD_DTR_24	But we all are not the same.
05_PRO_NEU_DTR_25	You are being dramatic.
05_PAN_NEU_SEQ_28	Maybe you are genuinely stupid after all.
05_PAN_NEU_SEQ_29	LEAVE. ME. ALOOOOONE.
05_PAN_NEU_SEQ_30	...
05_PAN_SAD_SEQ_31	Well. Maybe you are right. Who knows.
05_PAN_SAD_SEQ_32	Just... let me rest. I have to think.
05_PAN_NEU_SEQ_33	...
05_PAN_CON_SEQ_34	*sight* Just let me be. I don't wanna talk.
02_PRO_NEU_DTR_01	... [stay silent]
